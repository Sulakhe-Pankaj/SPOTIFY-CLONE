## How to Run

This project does not require any build tools.

### Option 1: Open Directly

- Open `index.html` in your browser

### Option 2: Use Live Server (Recommended)

If using VS Code:

- Install Live Server extension
- Right-click `index.html`
- Click **Open with Live Server**

This avoids audio and file loading issues.

---

## Functionality Overview

- Audio is controlled using the HTML5 Audio API
- JavaScript handles:
  - Play and pause logic
  - Progress bar synchronization
  - Volume adjustment
  - Song metadata updates
- CSS handles responsiveness using flexbox and media queries

If audio does not play, your file paths are wrong.

## Limitations

- No backend
- No real Spotify API integration
- No playlists persistence
- No authentication or user accounts

This is intentional.

---

## Learning Objectives

- DOM manipulation
- Media control using JavaScript
- Responsive UI design
- Frontend project structuring
- Clean UI replication

If you cannot explain how the Audio API works, you did not learn enough.
